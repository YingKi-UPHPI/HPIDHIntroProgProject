Summary of dataset:
The Hearing Wellness Survey 2025 captures public perceptions, habits, and awareness around hearing health, with a focus on the growing risks from prolonged earphone and headphone use. Conducted among diverse age groups, the survey explores how individuals value hearing, their experiences with hearing challenges, and their openness to digital solutions for hearing care.

This dataset provides detailed insights into:
🎯 Demographics – Age group distribution of respondents
🎧 Listening Habits – Daily headphone/earphone usage patterns
⚠ Hearing Risks – Incidence of discomfort, ringing, or pain
🚧 Barriers to Hearing Tests – Common reasons people avoid testing
📱 Digital Readiness – Interest in a mobile hearing health app and willingness to pay
💡 Feature Preferences – Desired functions in a hearing test app (e.g., quick tests, doctor consultations, sound personalization)

I will attempt to analyse the relationship between prolonged headphone used, important sounds missed, belife for early hearing care and then proceed to analyse the general interest vs interest in a paid hearing app, and the desired feature list
