Summary of dataset:
The Hearing Wellness Survey 2025 investigates the intersection of modern 
auditory habits and digital health adoption. This analysis focuses on the 18–24 
demographic to evaluate how prolonged personal audio use correlates with early 
signs of auditory strain (e.g. self-reported missing of important sounds) and 
the interest for mobile health interventions.
